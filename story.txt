The Wagner family found themselves late for their flight and lost in the Berlin flughafen. Jerry, the father in the family, had been caught in a kopfkino, fantasizing about hot summer days listening to musik, and eating bratwursts in the local biergarten, and lost track of time.
Jerry knew what had to be done: he hastily shoved his family into his BMW, put a Rammstein cd into the player, cranked the volume to 11, and told his wife and two kids to "Hold onto your lederhose." Jerry's idea was to drive his whole family to their vacation home in Italy even though that idea might be a luftschloss.
Terri, Jerry's wife, noticed that her husband was not thinking clearly as he muttered something about a short cut and turned off the hauptstrasse onto a questionable dirt road. Not only was the road rocky and bumpy, but the klimaanlage broke so everyone was extremely uncomfortable.
It was well into the night now, and after driving on the dirt road for many hours the Wagners decided to pull over for a quick rest when suddenly some kind of horrific beast wearing a dirndel effortlessly ripped Terri from the passenger window and disappeared into the night. Stunned, Jerry knew he had to think quick to save Terri, and out of nowhere, he had a schnapsidee.
