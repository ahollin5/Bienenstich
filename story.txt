The Wagner family found themselves late for their flight and lost in the Berlin flughafen. Jerry, the father in the family, had been caught in a kopfkino, fantasizing about hot summer days listening to musik, and eating bratwursts in the local biergarten, and lost track of time.
Jerry knew what had to be done: he hastily shoved his family into his BMW, put a Rammstein cd into the player, cranked the volume to 11, and told his wife and two kids to "Hold onto your lederhose." Jerry's idea was to drive his whole family to their vacation home in Italy even though that idea might be a luftschloss.
