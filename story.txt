The Wagner family found themselves late for their flight and lost in the Berlin flughafen. Jerry, the father in the family, had been caught in a kopfkino, fantasizing about hot summer days listening to musik, and eating bratwursts in the local biergarten, and lost track of time.
Jerry knew what had to be done: he hastily shoved his family into his BMW, put a Rammstein cd into the player, cranked the volume to 11, and told his wife and two kids to "Hold onto your lederhose."
